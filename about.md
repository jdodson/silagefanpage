description: Silage is a great band and history needs to be kept.

<p>
Back in the 90's Silage was my favorite band and still hold a very special place in my heart.  "Silage Fan Page" is an homage to the band I still love and a tongue-in-cheek send up of 90's websites I used to build that were terrible.  But weren't all 90's websites terrible?  Hopefully this project captures the nostalgia of the 90's web and some amazing historical beats of Silage, a band that needs to be remembered well into the modern age.

As a hardcore Silage fan from the 90's I have a fair amount in my collection but it is far from complete and if you have something I don't have, let me know.
