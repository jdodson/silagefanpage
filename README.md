# The Greatest Silage Fan Page On The Internet

Silage was one of my favorite bands in the 90's.  Back then I loved building webpages
and sharing them on Geocities but I never got around to making one for Silage.

This silage fan page uses:
* jekyll 3.4.2
* theme created in Seamonkey Composer & HTML 4

# setup / requirements

* ruby 2.3.1
* bundle

# serve the pages and regenerate when there is a change
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

# build a fresh version of the site
bundle exec jekyll build --destination docs
