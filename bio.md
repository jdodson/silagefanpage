If one were to ask the members of Silage, they would say that their hometown of Grass Valley, California has some of the worst drivers in the country. this has apparently caused Silage some moral duress, that is, according to their song "My Car Makes Me Sin" on their debut album Watusi.

Vocalist Damian Horne remarks, "In Grass Valley, we have people who always cut you off, who always drive 15mph in a 35mph zone, and who will never make a right turn at a red light even if the coast is clear for miles. The worst, though, are the tons of people who love to "cruise" in modified tweaked out cars and trucks and stare down at everyone they see. 'My Car Makes Me Sin' talks about how all this (and having a junked out car) can drive someone crazy."

Always light hearted and funny, Silage's are a reflection of the band members' good-natured personalities and their ska-influenced power-pop sound. This tongue-in-cheek attitude has led to such antics as doing an all Beach Boys set in concert and throwing a huge, lovable, stuffed monkey to the audience for the crowd to toss about. Likewise, Silage covered a Beach Boys song "Be True To Your School", named their album after a wacky dance, and has written some of the most happy-go-lucky music ever done in the Christian modern rock market.

Musically, the band takes the best elements of the ska, rap and punk of bands like 311, MXPX, Five Iron Frenzy and the Supertones, and combines them effortlessly into a sound that's fun, artistic and original. This diversity is heightened by the addition of unusual instruments on many songs, including the Hammond B-3 organ, eighties keyboard sounds, drum loops, a piano, and various percussion instruments.

To help capture this cool sound, Silage recorded at Front Page Studios (Sheryl Crow, Guns 'n' Roses) in Los Angeles, California. While there, the owner, an ex-member of the Ventures, came in and played some keyboards and sang some soaring, Monkees-esque harmonies. Silage also enlisted the talent of Monique Powell of the popular Orange County ska band Save Ferris on background vocals, and Josh Haquist of Diesel on trumpet. Bringing it all together was noted Orange County ska and punk band engineer/producer Craig Nepp.

Anyone who sees or hears Silage recognizes their desire to be fun and energetic, and it is this cheerful spirit that best defines the band's ministry. Silage uses their humor and joy to challenge people to re-evaluate their lives and what they accept so easily. Ultimately, the band just wants people to be happy.

Damian remarks, "Our song 'Smile' explains how we want to make people smile and share the joy we've found in our relationships with God. Some people want people to feel guilty and down. we want them to see the opposite. We want them to see a relationship with God that is positive, happy, and encouraging, presented with joy and love. That's what Silage is all about.
Silage's powerful goal has inspired them to bring together witty songwriting, enthusiastic live shows, and a positive outlook that will make them a landmark in progressive Christian music. With so much going for them, it was worth the risk for Silage to come out of Grass Valley, even with all those scary drivers swerving in their path.
